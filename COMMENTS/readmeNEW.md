# Kernel Build Automation Toolkit

This toolkit automates building and packaging Linux kernels across different architectures and configurations. It streamlines building clean, reproducible kernels and offers tooling for:
- Kernel compilation for multiple targets
- Repackaging kernels for custom images
- Environment setup with containerized consistency
- Advanced configuration presets and overrides

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Configure
```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/kernel-toolkit.git
cd kernel-toolkit
```

### 2. Setup environment
Make sure you're running on a compatible system. For consistency, the toolkit supports Docker-based builds.

#### Run inside container
```bash
./bin/container-run.sh bash
```
> This wraps your shell inside a clean container environment (Ubuntu-based) with preinstalled dependencies. It guarantees build reproducibility regardless of host OS.

---

## 🛠️ Core Usage

### Building the kernel (from the container)
```bash
./bin/kernel.sh --arch arm64 --config pixel_5_defconfig --target dtboimage
```

### Key Bash snippet: Modular argument handling
Inside `bin/kernel.sh`:
```bash
for arg in "$@"; do
  case "$arg" in
    --arch=*) ARCH="${arg#*=}" ;;
    --config=*) KCONFIG="${arg#*=}" ;;
    --target=*) TARGETS+=("${arg#*=}") ;;
    ...
  esac
done
```
> This dynamic flag parsing enables easily extensible options (`--foo=bar`) without hardcoding the sequence, keeping `kernel.sh` versatile.

### Commonly used targets:
- `image` — Build kernel image
- `dtboimage` — Build device tree blobs
- `modules` — Compile and install external modules
- `clean` — Clean build tree

---

## ⚙️ Config and Preset System

Configuration is layered:
1. **Global defaults** in `etc/config-defaults.sh`
2. **Per-device presets** in `etc/presets/*.sh`
3. **User overrides** passed via command line or env

### Example: Preset file structure

```bash
# etc/presets/pixel_5.sh
ARCH=arm64
KERNEL_DEFCONFIG=pixel_5_defconfig
TARGETS=(image dtboimage)
```

### Apply a preset manually
```bash
source etc/presets/pixel_5.sh
./bin/kernel.sh
```

> 🧠 **Why this matters:** Separating config logic from build logic reduces duplication and makes it easier to scale to more devices or tweak builds independently.

---

## 🐳 Container-Based Environment

All builds are expected to occur in an isolated container:

```bash
./bin/container-run.sh bash
```

Key Bash logic:
```bash
if [[ -n "$CI" ]]; then
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/src kernel-builder
else
  exec docker run -it -v "$PWD":/src kernel-builder bash
fi
```

> This block conditionally adjusts behavior depending on whether you're running in CI vs interactively, using `exec` for PID 1 replacement in local sessions.

---

## 🪄 Bash Highlights: Important Logic Explained

### Dynamic toolchain detection
```bash
TOOLCHAIN_DIR="$(find /opt/toolchains -type d -name 'gcc-*' | sort | tail -n1)"
```
> Ensures that the most recent available toolchain is selected without hardcoding paths.

### Build log management
```bash
exec &> >(tee -a "$LOG_FILE")
```
> Redirects all output to both stdout and a persistent log file. Crucial for debugging CI or headless builds.

### Fail-fast error handling
```bash
set -euo pipefail
```
> Ensures scripts immediately exit on:
- Any failed command (`-e`)
- Use of undefined variables (`-u`)
- Failures in piped commands (`-o pipefail`)

---

## 🧼 Cleaning and Reset

Clean up all build artifacts:
```bash
./bin/kernel.sh --target clean
```

To reset everything including temp/cache:
```bash
rm -rf tmp/ out/
```

> Use this when switching kernel versions or debugging persistent build issues.

---

## 🔒 Concurrency & Synchronization in Bash

As this toolkit may be invoked in concurrent CI environments or by multiple users on shared systems, **safe concurrent access** to shared files or build resources is critical.

### 🔐 File Locking with `flock`

Many scripts in the toolkit use `flock` to serialize access to shared artifacts such as logs, temp files, or build directories.

#### **Snippet: Locking critical sections**
```bash
(
  flock -n 200 || exit 1
  echo "Safe section: only one process enters"
  do_critical_work
) 200>/tmp/build.lock
```

> 🧠 **Why this matters**: Ensures mutual exclusion — prevents race conditions during builds or cleanup tasks. `-n` makes the lock non-blocking: if another process holds the lock, it exits immediately.

This mechanism is used in:
- `kernel.sh` during artifact staging
- `cleanup.sh` when purging logs or outputs
- Any script accessing shared system-wide logs or timestamps

---

### 🧪 Example: Handling Background Tasks Safely

#### **Snippet: Backgrounding with cleanup**
```bash
tmpfile=$(mktemp)
some_long_command > "$tmpfile" &
pid=$!

# Wait and cleanup safely
wait "$pid"
rm -f "$tmpfile"
```

> Ensures that even async operations have clean teardown steps, preventing **temporary file buildup** or resource leaks.

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Debugging

System resource monitoring during builds is especially important in CI environments or on resource-constrained devices.

### 🧠 Built-in Resource Checks

#### **Snippet: Monitoring CPU/Memory/Disk**
```bash
echo "CPU: $(uptime)"
echo "Memory: $(free -h)"
echo "Disk: $(df -h /)"
```

Included in `health-check.sh` and pre-run checks in `container-run.sh`.

> When integrated into automation pipelines, this offers **early warnings** if your environment lacks sufficient RAM, CPU cores, or disk space.

---

## 🧹 Logging & Temporary File Hygiene

Well-managed logs and temp files are essential in any long-lived project. The toolkit includes built-in housekeeping logic.

### 🗑️ Log Cleanup Logic

```bash
find logs/ -type f -name '*.log' -mtime +7 -delete
```

> Removes logs older than 7 days. Prevents clutter on long-running systems and is safe for CI/CD runners with persistent workspaces.

### 🧪 Temp File Hygiene Example

```bash
TMPFILE=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$TMPFILE"' EXIT

echo "Some intermediate data" > "$TMPFILE"
process "$TMPFILE"
```

> Ensures all temporary files are deleted automatically, even if the script crashes. The `trap` ensures cleanup **on all exits**.

---

## 🧠 Safe Resource Allocation Analogy: The Banker's Algorithm

While not implemented directly, the build system behaves like a conservative resource allocator.

### Conceptual Parallel:

- **Processes = concurrent build targets**
- **Resources = disk, CPU cores, RAM**
- **Build scripts = Bankers ensuring safety before granting build steps**

Example check before parallel builds:
```bash
JOBS=$(nproc)
[[ $JOBS -ge 4 ]] || {
  echo \"Not enough cores. Falling back to single-threaded build\"
  MAKEFLAGS=-j1
}
```

> 🧠 **Why it matters**: This protects the system from entering a \"deadlocked\" or \"unsafe\" state by checking available capacity before committing to a heavy operation — echoing the **Banker’s Algorithm** in spirit.

---

## 🧭 Deadlocks and Safe Execution Practices

### 🔄 Deadlock Conditions (Real Risk in Concurrent Scripts)

In scripting environments—especially when multiple processes:
- wait for each other’s resources,
- run asynchronous tasks,
- or write to shared files—

deadlocks are a real danger.

#### **What the toolkit avoids:**
- Holding multiple locks at once (prevents circular wait)
- Failing to release temp files (prevents resource starvation)
- Waiting indefinitely on IO (prevents infinite blocking)

### ✅ Best Practices in Use (From Classic Deadlock Theory)

| Deadlock Condition       | Toolkit Prevention Example                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Mutual exclusion         | `flock` for write access only, avoids for reads         |
| Hold and wait            | Never hold one resource while waiting for another       |
| No preemption            | Uses timeouts on locks or aborts safely                 |
| Circular wait            | Locks are always acquired in consistent order           |

#### **Bash Implementation Snippet: Timeout-Based Lock**
```bash
(
  flock -w 5 200 || {
    echo \"Could not acquire lock within 5 seconds. Exiting safely.\"
    exit 1
  }
  critical_task
) 200>/tmp/build.lock
```

> 💡 This avoids infinite waiting and illustrates practical deadlock **avoidance**, not just detection.

---

## 🧩 Scheduling Logic (Inspired by the Sleeping Barber)

Just like OS schedulers decide which process runs next, this build system ensures:
- Long operations don’t hog the terminal (via backgrounding)
- Queued builds get processed based on available resources
- Resource idleness is minimized (just like the barber’s chair)

### Snippet: Backgrounding + Monitoring
```bash
./bin/build-logs.sh &
log_pid=$!

./bin/kernel.sh --target image

wait "$log_pid"
```

> Allows continuous logging (consumer) while the kernel build runs (producer). **Two jobs, safely synchronized**.

---

## 🔁 Initialization Scripts

To avoid race conditions or undefined environments, the toolkit uses **initialization stubs**.

### Snippet: Lock File Prep (From Readers-Writers/Deadlock Lessons)

```bash
LOCKDIR=/tmp/kernel-locks
mkdir -p "$LOCKDIR"
touch "$LOCKDIR/build.lock"
```

> Ensures all locks are in place *before* any script starts. Inspired by init strategies in:
- `7deadlockV2firsttorun.sh`
- `3Readers-WritersSEMAPHOREiniSCRIPTS.sh`

---

## 🧼 Defensive Programming Patterns

To ensure stability, nearly all scripts in this toolkit follow robust defensive design patterns.

### Common Header in All Scripts

```bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\\n\\t'
```

| Option           | Purpose                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `-e`             | Exit immediately on any error                          |
| `-u`             | Treat unset variables as errors                        |
| `-o pipefail`    | Fail a pipeline if any command fails                   |
| `IFS` reset      | Prevent word splitting bugs in filenames with spaces  |

---

## 🧠 Process Behavior Modeling: Readers & Writers

Some scripts (e.g., for config overlays or logs) are read frequently but rarely written.

### Readers-Writers Model in Practice

```bash
# Multiple read-only processes (safe)
cat logs/*.log | grep ERROR

# One writer (must lock)
(
  flock -x 200
  echo \"New error log entry\" >> logs/errors.log
) 200>logs/errors.log.lock
```

> Allows safe parallel reads, but exclusive writes. This mirrors classic **Readers-Writers Problem** handling.

---

## 🧵 Threaded/Parallel Builds (Controlled)

Though simple Bash builds are single-threaded, this toolkit allows parallel builds via `make -j` — but **only after checking safety.**

```bash
CORES=$(nproc)
[[ "$CORES" -ge 4 ]] && JOBS=$CORES || JOBS=1
make -j"$JOBS"
```

> Ensures we don’t launch unsafe parallelism on low-resource machines, just like a well-trained **Banker**.

---


## 🧽 Cleanup Strategies and Robust Shutdowns

Cleaning up after build processes is as important as the build itself. Improper cleanup can lead to:

- Disk space exhaustion
- Stale locks and temp files
- Confusing logs or output duplication

### 🧼 Script Snippet: Safe Cleanup
```bash
cleanup() {
  echo "Cleaning up..."
  rm -f "$LOCK_FILE" "$TMP_FILE"
}
trap cleanup EXIT
```

> This pattern ensures cleanup *even if* the script is interrupted or crashes — a key lesson from real-world systems where resilience is critical.

---

## 🛠 Summary: Toolkit Design Philosophy (as Inspired by OS Theory)

| OS Concept                      | How It’s Reflected in the Toolkit                                |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Concurrency**                 | Safe parallel builds, async logging, job scheduling               |
| **Synchronization (flock)**     | Controlled access to shared logs, build outputs, temp files       |
| **Deadlock prevention**         | Lock acquisition timeouts, ordered resource handling              |
| **Banker’s algorithm (safety)** | Resource checks before parallelization, fallback behaviors        |
| **Sleeping Barber (scheduling)**| CI task sequencing, idle detection, background process management |
| **Readers-Writers**             | Safe concurrent log reading vs exclusive writing                  |

## 📘 For Students and New Contributors

This toolkit not only builds kernels but serves as a **hands-on lab** for key operating systems concepts implemented with shell scripting.

### Topics You Can Learn by Exploring the Code:

- File locking with `flock` (and what happens if you skip it!)
- Temporary file management and why `trap` is critical
- How to debug builds through structured logging
- How to mimic OS-level scheduling and allocation logic in userland
- Classic concurrency problems (Dining Philosophers, Sleeping Barber, etc.) implemented in real scripts

### Suggested Learning Path:

1. **Start with** `kernel.sh` – understand argument parsing and targets
2. **Read** `container-run.sh` – how consistent environments are built
3. **Study** `init.sh` and `cleanup.sh` – resource safety and lifecycle
4. **Trace logs** in `logs/` to see output behaviors and error capture
5. **Modify** presets to build for different devices or configs
6. **Implement** your own script using `flock` and `mktemp` safely
