This script simulates a network packet capture and analysis scenario. It demonstrates concepts like process management, background execution, file manipulation 
and basic string searching. We'll explore how the script simulates capturing packets, analyzing them for suspicious content, and managing the capture and analysis processes.

Concepts and Commands:

getent passwd: Retrieves information about a user.
cut command: Extracts specific fields from text.
mkdir -p: Creates a directory, including any missing parent directories.
date command: Retrieves the current date and time.
shuf command: Generates random numbers within a specified range.
/dev/urandom: Reads random data from the system's random number generator.
tr command: Transforms characters in a string.
head command: Outputs the first n lines of a file (used here to get a limited amount of random data).
grep command: Searches for patterns within text files.
mv command: Moves files.
rm -rf command: Removes files or directories recursively (use with caution!).
Background processes (&): Started processes that run concurrently with the main script.
wait command: Waits for all background processes to finish before continuing.
trap command: Traps signals and executes a specific function.
kill command: Sends a signal to a process (used here with TERM signal to terminate processes).

Script Logic:

Configuration:

Defines the network interface for capturing packets (currently unused in simulation).
Gets the user's home directory.
Sets base and directory paths for packet queue and analysis storage.
Defines a runtime limit for the script execution (20 seconds).
setup_environment function:

Creates the packet_queue and packet_analysis directories if they don't exist.
start_time variable:

Captures the current timestamp at script start using date +%s.
capture_packets function:

Uses a while true loop to continuously simulate packet capture:
Checks the current time and calculates the elapsed time since script start.
If the runtime limit is reached, exits the loop and prints a message.
Simulates a packet with random source and destination IP addresses and random data generated from /dev/urandom using shuf and head.
Creates a file with a unique name for the simulated packet in the packet_queue directory.
Prints a message indicating the captured packet and its filename.
Introduces a short delay (sleep) to simulate the interval between packet captures.
analyze_packets function:

Uses a while true loop to continuously analyze packets from the queue:
Checks the current time and calculates the elapsed time since script start.
If the runtime limit is reached, exits the loop and prints a message.
Loops through all files in the packet_queue directory.
For each file (simulated packet):
Checks if it's a regular file using -f.
Simulates packet analysis by searching for the string "DATA=.*baddata" using grep.
If suspicious content is found, prints an alert message with the packet content.
Moves the analyzed packet to the packet_analysis directory using mv.
Prints a message indicating the packet analysis and movement.
Introduces a delay (sleep) to simulate the time between analyzing packets.
cleanup function:

Called on script exit using trap EXIT.
Removes all files from both the packet_queue and analysis_dir directories using rm -rf (caution: use with care!).
Prints a message indicating the packet queues have been cleared.

Main Script Logic:

Sets a trap to ensure cleanup is called when the script exits (EXIT).
Starts the capture_packets function in the background (&) and stores its process ID (PID) in capture_pid.
Starts the analyze_packets function in the background (&) and stores its PID in analyze_pid.
Starts another background process that waits for the runtime limit ($runtime_limit) seconds and then sends a termination signal (TERM) to both capture_pid and `analyze it.

Packet Capture and Analysis Simulation Explanation:

The script utilizes two background processes:
capture_packets: Simulates capturing packets and writing them to the queue directory.
analyze_packets: Continuously checks the queue directory for new packets, analyzes them for suspicious content, and moves them to the analysis directory.
Both processes check the runtime limit periodically and exit if reached.
The grep command with a pattern like "DATA=.*baddata" simulates searching for specific content in the packet data. You can customize this pattern to match your desired criteria for suspicious content.
The sleep commands in both functions introduce delays to simulate realistic time intervals between packet captures and analysis.
Logical Schema:

+-------------------+      +----------------------+      +-------------------+
| Capture Packets    | ----> | Packet Queue (Dir)   | ----> | Analyze Packets   |
+-------------------+      +----------------------+      +-------------------+
                    |          (Files)           |                    |
                    | (Simulated Packets)      |                    v
                    v                          v (if suspicious content)
                Captured packets              Alert: Suspicious packet
                written to queue              detected and logged
                                                Analyzed packets
                                                moved to analysis dir
TODO:

Integrate with a real packet capture tool (e.g., tcpdump) instead of simulating packet capture.
Implement more sophisticated packet analysis using libraries or tools like tcpflow for deeper inspection.
Design a mechanism for configuring the network interface, capture duration, and suspicious content patterns.
Enhance error handling to gracefully handle potential issues like file system errors or process failures.
This script provides a basic framework for simulating packet capture and analysis. By extending it with real tools and functionalities, you can create a more robust network monitoring system for 
detecting suspicious activity.
