# Initial Database Configuration
[DatabaseConfig]
MaxConnections=100



#This configuration file will manage settings for a hypothetical database system. 
##It will include parameters such as the maximum number of connections that can be simultaneously open to the database. 
###This is a typical setting that might need adjustment based on the system's workload and performance requirements.


#Here, MaxConnections is set to 100, which represents the initial maximum number of database connections allowed. 
##This setting can be dynamically adjusted by the services to respond to varying load conditions, as simulated in the Bash script.
