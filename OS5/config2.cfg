LogLevel=INFO




#This file will contain application-specific settings, particularly focusing on logging configurations. 
##The log level is a common setting that might be adjusted dynamically to increase or decrease the 
###verbosity of log output based on debugging needs or performance considerations.


#In this case, LogLevel is set to INFO, which is a moderate level of logging that provides general 
##operational information without the verbosity of a debug level. This setting could be adjusted 
###to DEBUG to provide more detailed logging, which is helpful during troubleshooting or development.
